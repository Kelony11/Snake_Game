# SNAKE GAME  🐍

# PROJECT OVERVIEW 🚀🚀🚀

This Python based snake game is a recreation of my favorite childhood game played on Nokia 3310. 
It's a classic arcade snake game, introducing a pioneering snake class that grows through an advanced array advanced array shifting and traversal algorithm.
So, in simplier terms, the snake starts as an two inch rectangle and grow in size as it eats more food planted on a random loactions in the interface. 
This was one of the games i enjoyed planning growing up. 

# KEY FEATURES 🔑
🟢 Adjustable Screen: Applied a scale algorithm to dynamically update resolutions, ensuring a seamless gaming experience across various devices and screen sizes.
🟢 Score Tracker: I used the text file to store the user's highest score and diplay it whenever the user chooses to play again, so that it the users can be able to beat their
  highest score. 
🟢 Simple and Easy-to_Understand: I created the game so that it is situatable for all age groups. It also uses the up-down-left-right keys on your keyboard to play. 

# TECHNICAL STACK 🧱
🟢 PYTHON: I utilized python including it's libraries like Turtle (To display the game to your console) and various functions to detect collision against the wall and food.
